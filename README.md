# ChatService
# Simple Chat Server & Client

This is a simple chat server & client(s) application written in Java.
This was just a side project that I worked on in order to learn more about Network sockets & Concurrent Programming practices in the language.
The code was heavily inspired by the book [Head First Java - Kathy Sierra](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-java/0596009208/)

This project was a learning exercise and isn't actually intended to be used as a chat server/client; but I suppose we could work on that ;)
